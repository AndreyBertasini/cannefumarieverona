# Canne Fumarie Verona Website

## Recent Changes

The following changes were made to fix the issue of a blank page when hosting the site on GitHub Pages with Cloudflare:

1. **Added explicit page initialization**: Added code to explicitly call `showPage('home')` when the page loads, ensuring that the home page content is displayed properly.
   - Location: `index.html`, in the DOMContentLoaded event handler around line 3981

2. **Fixed duplicate JavaScript code**: Removed duplicate `setupFaqSearch()` function and its associated DOMContentLoaded event handler to prevent potential JavaScript execution issues.
   - Location: `index.html`, around lines 225-294

3. **Added Cloudflare cache control meta tags**: Added meta tags to prevent Cloudflare and browsers from caching the page, ensuring that the latest version of the JavaScript is always loaded and executed properly.
   - Location: `index.html`, in the head section around line 25

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **JavaScript Organization**: Consider moving JavaScript code to external files in the `js` directory instead of embedding it directly in the HTML files. This will make the code easier to maintain and debug.

2. **Cloudflare Configuration**: If you continue to experience issues with Cloudflare, consider adjusting the Cloudflare settings in the Cloudflare dashboard:
   - Set the caching level to "Standard" instead of "Aggressive"
   - Enable the "Development Mode" temporarily when making changes to the site
   - Configure Page Rules to bypass cache for specific URLs if needed

3. **GitHub Pages Configuration**: Ensure that your GitHub Pages repository is properly configured:
   - Make sure the repository is public
   - Verify that the GitHub Pages source is set to the correct branch (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Consider using a custom domain if you're experiencing issues with the default GitHub Pages domain

4. **Testing**: Always test the site locally before deploying to GitHub Pages with Cloudflare to ensure that everything works as expected.

5. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to the JavaScript code to catch and log any errors that might occur during execution. This will make it easier to diagnose issues in the future.

## Testing the Solution

A test page has been created to help verify that the JavaScript is working properly before deploying to GitHub Pages with Cloudflare:

1. Open the `test.html` file in your browser
2. Run the tests on the page to verify that:
   - JavaScript is executing properly
   - The DOMContentLoaded event is firing correctly
   - Page content can be shown and hidden properly

If all tests pass locally, the changes should work when deployed to GitHub Pages with Cloudflare.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Commit and push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site
3. Clear your browser cache or use an incognito/private browsing window to access your site
4. If you still see a blank page, check the browser's developer console for any errors

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues with the site showing a blank page when hosted on GitHub Pages with Cloudflare, try the following:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private browsing window
3. Temporarily disable Cloudflare by setting the DNS records to point directly to GitHub Pages
4. Check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors
5. Verify that all JavaScript files are being loaded properly

If none of these solutions work, consider reaching out to Cloudflare support for assistance with your specific configuration.
